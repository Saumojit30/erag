## 1. Executive Summary & Configuration Freeze

Based on the controlled empirical sweeps conducted across Dev-100 in Phase 2, we have established and frozen three distinguishable system configurations:

    subgraph Architectures["Three Formal E-RAG Operating Configurations"]
        REF["Configuration A: E-RAG-Reference<br/>(Unchanged Historical Baseline)<br/>k=5, Always Resample, Full Extract<br/>14.46 Calls/Q | $1.014 / 1K Q | EM: 0.5000"]
        COST["Configuration B: E-RAG-Cost<br/>(Extreme Frugality Baseline)<br/>k=2, Never Resample, Direct Query, 1 Claim<br/>3.44 Calls/Q | $0.211 / 1K Q | EM: 0.3600"]
        BAL["Configuration C: E-RAG-Balanced<br/>(Recommended Optimal Pareto Variant)<br/>k=3, Conditional Resample, Incremental DAG, Pre-NLI<br/>8.92 Calls/Q | $0.576 / 1K Q | EM: 0.5100"]
    end
```

> **Note on the dollar figures above:** these are **Dev-100** costs, recomputed from `results/cost_opt/` (Reference $1.0136, Balanced $0.5755 per 1k questions). The Test-400 costs for the same configurations are $1.0079 (Reference) and $0.5542 (Balanced) per 1k (−45.0%), per `research/cost/operation_cost_test400.csv` — the two splits' figures must not be mixed.

## 4. Scientific Trade-Off & Pareto Analysis

```
Accuracy (Exact Match)
  ^
  |        [Balanced] (EM=0.510, Cost=$0.576)   [Reference] (EM=0.500, Cost=$1.014)
  |            *                                      *
  |
  |
  |   [Cost Mode] (EM=0.360, Cost=$0.211)

  +-------------------------------------------------------------> Computational Cost ($ / 1K Questions)
```
(Costs in this diagram are Dev-100 costs; Test-400 costs are $1.0079 Reference / $0.5542 Balanced per 1k, −45.0% — see the note in §1.)

### Key Analytical Takeaways:
1. **Configuration C (E-RAG-Balanced) strictly dominates Configuration A (Reference):**
   - It achieves a higher Exact Match ($0.5100$ vs $0.5000$) and higher Selective EM ($0.6711$ vs $0.6494$).
   - It achieves lower Brier calibration error ($0.2459$ vs $0.2497$).
   - It slashes monetary expenditure by **$43.2\%$** (\$0.5755 vs \$1.0136 per 1,000 questions).
   - This occurs because trimming self-consistency from $k=5$ to $k=3$ and gating post-hop resampling eliminates noisy borderline samples while retaining strong consensus on core entities.
2. **Configuration B (E-RAG-Cost) defines the Lower Bound:**
   - For applications with extreme latency or budget restrictions, Configuration B reduces LLM calls by **$76.6\%$** ($3.44$ calls/Q) and cost by **$80.5\%$** (\$0.211/1K Q), approaching IRCoT's cost envelope (\$0.169/1K Q).
   - However, the compression to a single atomic claim and $k=2$ samples reduces multi-hop reasoning capability, dropping EM to $0.3600$.

## 5. Recommendation for Phase 3 & Beyond

- **Frozen Reference Baseline:** Retain Configuration A (`configs/final.yaml`) as the historical anchor.
- **Primary Research Variant:** Promote **Configuration C (E-RAG-Balanced, `configs/erag_balanced.yaml`)** as the primary optimized E-RAG model for Phase 3 (Cost-Effectiveness Validation), Phase 4 (IRCoT Comparison), and Phase 5 (Multi-Retriever Benchmarking).
- **Test-400 Preservation:** Neither Configuration B nor Configuration C has been evaluated on Test-400. They remain cleanly tuned on Dev-100 without any test set contamination.
